Which jobs are most crucial?
-structure placement : making sure structures don't overlap, making sure player can afford to buy them
-troop placement : making sure player can afford to buy them, making sure you can train them, making sure you can tell them to target an enemy
-enemy spawning/targeting : making sure they spawn in waves and get progressively harder, making sure their pathfinding works, making sure they drop money when killed

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
-essential: structures, troops, enemy
-non essential: music, pictures, extra structures, pretty attacking motions, spells

Which components are prerequisites for others?
-structures are the basis, then an overall unit that encompasses enemy and troop, then development on either one
-once all of that is built in, the player gold

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
-Kevin: structures, gold, troop spawning, troop upgrading
-Connie: enemy spawning (waves, etc) and targeting, troop targeting

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
