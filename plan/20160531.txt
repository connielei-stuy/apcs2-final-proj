Tuesday 5/30

Final Project Due Date

Everything is currently a soft deadline, meaning it can be pushed back. We left extra time once all functionality has been added to work out the kinks. 

The tasks will be staggered, meaning that Kevin will work on building functionality and I will work on enemies, then he works on troops and training queue, etc.
